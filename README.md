# Conway's Game of the Life

This repository has two implementations of Conway's Game of the life one in Python and other in JavaScript. The python uses the [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/news) library to create the interface. That solution based on [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPtKv9fSHZY). The Javascript solution uses [P5.js](https://p5js.org) library and follows the same logic in the python implementation.
